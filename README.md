# Calculator

## I wanted to improve my Javascript Skill set and A Calculator seemed the best app that will use some really good functionality and fun to build.

# so let's break things into pieces one by one.

### first let's talk about the html
- The HTML file contains just the basic buttons and the container that is my whole calculator.
- [html_file](https://github.com/Alucard2169/Calculator/blob/main/index.html)

### On to the CSS
- I used Grid to design the whole layout
- As Grid is now widly used among so many different web designs and grid makes things looks more asthetic.
- CSS Grid is one of the main things in CSS nowdays and this project seemed to be the best way to improve my grid skills.
- I used a light background for the body to make it look more pleasing.

## Now the main part ( THE JAVASCRIPT FILE )
- I used Object oriented approch to build this project.

- The main object is the calculator
- it takes two parameters which is `previousNumber` ( the number that was entered before) and `currentNumber` (the number that is being entered now )
- The object `calculator` has certain methods
   - `del()` To delete the last digit of the current input
   - `clear()` To clear out the `previous` as well as `current` input and the `operator`
   - `calc()` To caculate the result 
   - `currentOperator()` that watches for the operator and once a operator is selected the `currentinput` becomes the `previousInput` and the calculation goes on
   - `appendInput` responsible for adding the numbers to the `current`and `previous` input
   - `updateDisplay()` responsible for updating the display on the screen mainly on the calculator



## what i learned doing this project:

- CSS GRID
- Object oriented programing
- JS functionality
- Best pracitices
