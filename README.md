# Calculator

### First let's talk about the HTML
- The HTML file contains just the basic buttons and the container of my whole calculator.

### On to the CSS
- I used Grid to design the whole layout
- As the Grid is now widely used among so many different web designs, the grid makes things look more aesthetic.
- CSS Grid is one of the main things in CSS nowadays and this project is the best way to improve my grid skills.
- I used a light background for the body to make it look more pleasing.

## Now the main part ( THE JAVASCRIPT FILE )
- I used an Object-oriented approach to build this project.

- The main object is the calculator
- it takes two parameters which are `previousnumber` ( the number that was entered before) and `current number` (the number that is being entered now )
- The object `calculator` has certain methods
   - `del()` To delete the last digit of the current input
   - `clear()` To clear out the `previous` as well as `current` input and the `operator`
   - `calc()` To calculate the result 
   - `currentoperator()` that watches for the operator and once an operator is selected the `currentinput` becomes the `previousinput` and the calculation goes on
   - `appendInput` responsible for adding the numbers to the `current`and `previous` input
   - `updateDisplay()` is responsible for updating the display on the screen mainly on the calculator



## What I learned doing this project:

- CSS GRID
- Object-oriented programing
- JS functionality
- Best practices
